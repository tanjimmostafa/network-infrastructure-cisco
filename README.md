# Network infrastructure in cisco packet tracer

As part of coursework, I had to build an extensive network infrastructure as per requirements.

- The Topic 6 - NASA_SpaceX.pdf contains the question paper with specifications.
- project-cse421-final-draft.pkt contains the packet tracer file.
- CSE 421 Project - Group 605.pdf contains the addressing table, diagram, commands etc. so that one could understand how it works and replicate the project from scratch.
